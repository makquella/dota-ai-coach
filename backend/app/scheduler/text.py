"""
scheduler.text - stateless recommendation-text normalization helpers.

Pure functions, no scheduler state, no ``self``. Extracted verbatim from
advice_scheduler.py as part of the Phase 2 split (no behavior change).

The MAX_ACTION_LENGTH / MAX_REASON_LENGTH constants live here because they
are coupled to truncation; advice_scheduler.py imports them back so that
_is_safe_recommendation (still local there until step 5) keeps compiling.
