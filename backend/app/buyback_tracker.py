"""
buyback_tracker.py - "you just spent your buyback gold" signal for live advice.

From minute 30 a carry should keep enough gold to buy back: one death without
it can decide the game. GSI gives the gold, the buyback cost and its cooldown.
When a purchase takes the gold from at least the buyback cost to below it
while buyback is ready and the hero is alive, the signal holds for
HOLD_SECONDS of game time (or until the gold is back) so the advice pipeline
can show it once. Deaths (gold lost while dead) never count.
