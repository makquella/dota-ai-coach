"""
coach_review.py - AI coach texts on top of the rule-based reviews.

The rules (post_match_analysis, career_analysis) stay the source of every
number and conclusion. This module turns their output into a compact JSON of
facts, asks the model to explain the match (or the last matches) like a coach
watching the replay, and checks the answer before it is shown:

- shape: the expected JSON fields, sizes, no markdown;
- facts: numbers, heroes and items must be present in the facts (plus small
  goals and minute marks). Supported combat counts and match rates bind to their metric.
  Sentences that fail are dropped; if
  too much is lost the model gets one retry with the list of offending
  tokens, then the answer is rejected.

Nothing here touches the live advice path.
